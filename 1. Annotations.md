# Annotations
**Bean Creation :** 
1. **@Component** - @Component is a class-level annotation. It is used to denote a class as a Component. We can use @Component across the application to mark the beans as Spring’s managed components
2. **@Configuration** - Annotating a class with @Configuration indicates that its primary purpose is as a source of bean definitions.It is used for explicit bean creation.
3. **@Bean** - @Bean is a method level annotation. The @Bean annotation is used to indicate that a method instantiates, configures, and initializes a new object to be managed by the Spring IoC container.It is used for explicit bean creation along with @Configuration annotation .
4. **@PostConstruct -** Spring calls the methods annotated with @PostConstruct only once, just after the initialization of bean properties. Keep in mind that these methods will run even if there’s nothing to initialize.The method annotated with @PostConstruct can have any access level, but it can’t be static.One possible use of @PostConstruct is populating a database. For instance, during development, we might want to create some default users
5. **@PreDestroy:** A method annotated with @PreDestroy runs only once, just before Spring removes our bean from the application context.Same as with @PostConstruct, the methods annotated with @PreDestroy can have any access level, but can’t be static. The purpose of this method should be to release resources or perform other cleanup tasks, such as closing a database connection, before the bean gets destroyed.

**Dependency Injection**

1. **@Autowired:** Used to achieve dependency injection. Used during field, setter and construction injection (when one contructor is present we can omit @Autowired annotation)
2. **@Primary:** Used at class level. By default spring injects beans based on its type. Spring gets confused when 2 beans of same are present. This annotation defines a preference when multiple beans of the same type are present. The bean associated with the @Primary annotation will be used unless otherwise indicated.
3.  **@Qualifier(bean name) :** @Qualifier can be used to explicitly specify which bean should be injected when multiple beans of same type are present i.e bean injection takes place based on the name rather than type.
4. **@Lazy** : Used to resolve circular dependency . It can be used on constructor level or class level


**Stereotype Annotations :**
( Using any of these annoations on a class will create a bean in spring container. Different lies in their usage purpose)
1. **@Component** - @Component is a class-level annotation. It is used to denote a class as a Component. We can use @Component across the application to mark the beans as Spring’s managed components
2. **@Service** - We specify a class with @Service to indicate that they’re holding the business logic. Besides being used in the service layer, there isn’t any other special use for this annotation. The utility classes can be marked as Service classes. (Ex : class containing a method to find factorial of a number)
3. **@Respository** - We specify a class with @Repository to indicate that they’re dealing with CRUD operations, usually, it’s used with DAO (Data Access Object) or Repository implementations that deal with database tables.
4. **@Controller** - We specify a class with @Controller to and responsible to indicate that a class serves as a controller, handle user requests and return the appropriate response. It is mostly used with REST Web Services.

**Spring MVC**

1. **@Controller :** - In Spring MVC, the @Controller annotation is used to mark a class as a Spring MVC controller. It indicates that the class contains methods that handle incoming HTTP requests and produce responses.

2. **@RequestMapping(" ") :** This annotation is used to map web requests to Spring Controller methods. This annotation is a versatile and flexible annotation that can be used with a controller (class) as well as the methods to map specific web requests with the handler methods and controllers

Before MVC : HttpServletRequest request, request.getParameter("num1),request.getParameter("num2), HttpSession session = req.getSession(),session.setAttribute("num3",num3)

3. **@RequestParam("num1") String id or @RequestParam(name="num1") String id or @RequestParam(value="num1") String id :** @RequestParam to extract query parameters, form parameters, and even files from the request.num1 is parameter in the url.That parameter value will be retreived using this annotation.
   
**@RequestParam(required = false) String id :** Method parameters annotated with @RequestParam are required by default. This means that if the parameter isn’t present in the request, we’ll get an error. We can configure our @RequestParam to be optional, though, with the required attribute. When the parameter isn’t specified, the method parameter is bound to null.

**@RequestParam(defaultValue = "test") :** We can also set a default value to the @RequestParam by using the defaultValue attribute.

4. **@ModelAttribute** : (as a method argument) When you have a form in your HTML page, you can use @ModelAttribute to bind the form fields to a Java object. This object can then be used in your controller methods. (at method level) You can use @ModelAttribute at the method level to add common attributes to the model that should be populated for multiple request mappings
5. **@GetMapping :** @RequestMapping(value = "/get/{id}", method = RequestMethod.GET) can be replaced with @GetMapping("/get/{id}")
6. **@PostMapping :** @RequestMapping(value = "/post/{id}", method = RequestMethod.POST) can be replaced with @PostMapping("/get/{id}").
7. **@PutMapping :**
8. **@DeleteMapping :**
9. **@PatchMapping :** PATCH is used for partial updates of resources, unlike PUT which replaces the entire resource.


**Spring Rest**

1. **@ResponseBody and @RequestBody:** https://www.baeldung.com/spring-request-response-bod


**Other Annotations**

1. **@SpringBootApplication :** Applied to the main class of the spring boot application .Uses a combination of @Documented, @Inherited, **@SpringBootConfiguration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan**
2. **@SpringBootConfiguration :** Same as configuration annotation. Here it should be used with @ComponentScan annotation for component scanning
3. **@EnableAutoConfiguration :** This annotation enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism, which automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have included in your project.
4. **@ComponentScan:** This annotation enables component scanning, which allows Spring to automatically discover and register beans in your application context.Main class takes this responsibility. By default all the subpackages of the main class package will be scanned. If we want spring to scan the other packages.We should explicity define a class and annotate it with **@Configuration, @ComponentScan(basePackages="packagepath")**.
