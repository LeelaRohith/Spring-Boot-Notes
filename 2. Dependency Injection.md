# Field Injection
Dependency is set to fields of class using @Autowired annotation

Advantages : 
Simple and easy to use

Disadvantes :
Cannot be used with immutable fields (most of the time we create immutable objects using final keyword)
Chances of Null pointer exception (chances are low but still possible)

# Setter Injection
Dependency is set using the setter of the field. Dependency is passed as a argument to the setter method
We have to annotate the setter method with @Autowired annotation

Advatnanges : 
Easy for Junit testing, we can pass mock objects

Disadvantages :
Cannot be used with immutable fields (most of the time we create immutable objects using final keyword)

# Constructor Injection (Most commonly used)
All the dependencied will be injected at the time of initialization. Dependencies are passed as arguments to the constructor

Advantanges : 
Makes 100% sure that our objects will be initialized with all the required dependencies
No null pointer exception
We can create immutable objects using constructor injection
