# Annotations
**Bean Creation :** 
1. **@Component** - @Component is a class-level annotation. It is used to denote a class as a Component. We can use @Component across the application to mark the beans as Springâ€™s managed components
2. **@Configuration** - Annotating a class with @Configuration indicates that its primary purpose is as a source of bean definitions.
3. **@Bean** - @Bean is a method level annotation. The @Bean annotation is used to indicate that a method instantiates, configures, and initializes a new object to be managed by the Spring IoC container.
